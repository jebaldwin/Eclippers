Eclippers provides support for patch files within Eclipse, which includes:

- Editor with syntax highlighting, including navigation to where the patch will apply or has applied. 
- Gutter annotations that show where a patch will apply (or where it has applied). 
- Visualisation to show where a patch applies across the entire system. 
- Language agnostic, with no compilation required. 

Eclippers was originally developed out of a personal need, but was later used within tool support for building Android apps called jimu. Demo videos of part of Eclippsers can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uUGD3IJyLM

You will need to either have AJDT or the Eclipse Visualiser installed in order to have the visualiser view. Alternatively, it is provided within this repository.
